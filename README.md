### What are subseries?
A subseries is to a series what a subsequence is to a sequence.

Formally, given a series S=a<sub>0</sub>+a<sub>1</sub>+a<sub>2</sub>+..., 
a subseries of S is any series S'= b<sub>0</sub>+b<sub>1</sub>+b<sub>2</sub>+... where either b<sub>j</sub>=a<sub>j</sub> or b<sub>j</sub>=0.

A well known subseries of the [harmonic series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(mathematics)) is the [Kempner series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kempner_series).
